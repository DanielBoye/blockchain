# Blockchain CTF challenges

This repository will contain all my solutions for CTF challenges in the blockchain category. 

Some challenges will be solved with [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/), [eth.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) or [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)


I have solved some of the hackthebox blockchain challenges, but I can not publish those writeups until the challenges gets retired. If you want guidance or help on those, please reach out to me :)
